# helmert2D
An example about 2D Helmert Similarity Transformation.
The Helmert transformation (named after Friedrich Robert Helmert, 1843â€“1917) is a transformation method within a three-dimensional space. It is frequently used in geodesy to produce distortion-free transformations from one datum to another. The Helmert transformation is also called a seven-parameter transformation and is a similarity transformation.
In this study, a numerical example about helmert similarity transformation was done.
